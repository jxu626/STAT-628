# STAT-628-project3

In this project, models will be built to analyze data from three sources, including Yelp, with the goal of helping restaurateurs find key drivers of restaurant success. By focusing on restaurants in Santa Barbara, CA, the most effective attributes to promote restaurant success will be extracted from 2019 through 2021.

This storage repository consists of three main code boards. 

The first is, "Data preprocessing to generate subdatasets.ipynb", which is the python code used for data visualization and data preprocessing.Additionally, it generates the sub-dataset merged_final (1).csv and Santa_distance.csv, utilizing data from three sources.

The second one is 'STAT_628_project3_model.R,' which is an R code used for building models. It exports the final dataset 'data_final_4.csv' for Shiny,using the 'merged_final (1).csv' data generated by the first step's code.

The third one is ‘STAT 628 yelp shiny.R’, which is an R code for Shiny, completed using 'Santa_distance.csv' and 'data_final_4.csv'
